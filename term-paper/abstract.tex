In the explorative study we investigate the Ethereum blockchain,  a decentralized crypto technology and a platform used for decentralized applications and currency transactions. 
The analysis covered 6 months of data, including transaction and economic data scraped from the Ethereum platform. 
The objective is to get closer insights into the Ethereum economy and find patterns in the data.
The study reveals information about the main senders and receivers during the analyzed period and the underlying business processes, plus information about the network design and potential security issues. 
Furthermore, we scrutinize certain consequences of the Ethereum hard fork that occured in 2016.
For the graph analysis the so called \emph{Small World Phenomenon} could not be confirmed for the whole network, but for subgraphs it holds true.
