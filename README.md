# Analyze the Ethereum-Blockchain

## Obtaining data

We plan to obtain data from

* `blockchain.info`
* `ipinfo.io`
* `blockchair.info`

in order to map out Ethereum transactions in terms of a graph-analysis.

## Methodology

We plan to analyse the network in terms of:
* distribution of degrees of nodes
* transitivity of network
